4K Ultra HD 
*gwLbwas
---------------------
If you’ve been following the television industry, 4K TV is something that manufacturers have been pushing since late 2012. Also known as ultra high-definition (UHD) or Ultra HD, 4K is the next step-up in resolution of flat-screen displays, offering four times the pixel resolution of a “regular” 1080p HDTV.

Technically, 4K refers to the 4096×2160 Digital Cinema resolution, whereas 3840×2160 should be classed as Ultra HD, but the term “4K” is just so much catchier – many TV makers have been using it to market their ultra high-def models even though their native screen resolution is 3840×2160. There have been calls from certain camps, notably video guru Joe Kane, to use “2160p” which is arguably the most accurate, all-encompassing description.

Due to increased pixel density and potentially higher bit-depth plus chroma resolution, the file sizes of 4K videos are understandably going to be much larger, making them more difficult to transmit, store and manage. To tackle this issue, h.265 (superseding h.26

Netflix 4K
Native 4K content remains very thin on the ground. While owners of Samsung and Sony 4K Ultra HD televisions in the USA have access to proprietary content in the form of the former’s UHD Video Pack and the latter’s 4K Media Player respectively, the choices available to UK and European viewers are much more limited, of which Netflix 4K is probably the most easily accessible.

House of Cards S2 in 4K
Video streaming specialist Netflix has begun offering a handful of material in ultra high-definition resolution, starting with political drama House Of Cards Season 2 back in April 2014, followed by

Best 2014 4K TVs
----------------

This second-generation ultra high-definition television from the Japanese manufacturer delivers some of the most gorgeous images we’ve seen from an LCD-based display, largely due to its unique ability to preserve colour saturation in darker scenes and also in 3D owing to Panasonic’s Studio Master Drive technology.

The Viera TX-65AX802B was voted as the best 4K TV in a 2014 comparison event we held, beating the Sony and the Samsungs, even though it doesn’t support Netflix 4K streaming. In our review of the 50-inch model, we also gave it our “Highly Recommended – Best in Class” award.

While the front-firing Magnetic Fluid speakers by the sides of the LCD screen may put off buyers with space constraints or their own surround sound setup, they undoubtedly provide the best audio quality of any flat-screen television we’ve tested to date. Here’s our full review of the 5

This isn’t even the Korean TV maker’s highest-end UHD television (that title belongs to the curved HU8500 series), but by virtue of its flat panel, its blacks and screen uniformity are slightly better than the HU8500.
As expected from a Samsung display, upscaling and video processing is top-notch. The supplied array of calibration controls is comprehensive, allowing greyscale and colours to be dialled in accurately. We’ve reviewed the 5
